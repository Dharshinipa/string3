Output:

The number of punctuations exists in the string is: 5
In the above program, we have used a for loop that iterates over the string and executes till the length of the string. For determining the position of the characters in a string, we have used the charAt() method that returns the character at the specified index in a string. For each iteration, each and every character is matched with the punctuation marks by using the == operator. If any character is matched with a punctuation mark the count variable is incremented by 1. At last, we have printed the value of the count variable.
